NAME
     sysdiagnose -- gathers system-wide diagnostic information helpful in
     investigating system performance issues

SYNOPSIS
     sysdiagnose -h
     sysdiagnose [-f results_directory] [-A archive_name] [-V volume_path]
                 [-n] [-k] [-F] [-S] [-u] [-Q] [-b] [-p] [-P] [-d] [-D] [-r]
                 [-R] [process_name | pid]

DESCRIPTION
     The sysdiagnose tool gathers system diagnostic information helpful in
     investigating system performance issues.  A great deal of information is
     harvested, spanning system state and configuration. The data is stored
     /var/tmp directory.  sysdiagnose needs to be run as root. To cancel an
     in-flight sysdiagnose triggered via command line interface, press Ctrl-\.
     sysdiagnose is automatically triggered when the following key chord is
     pressed: Control-Option-Command-Shift-Period.

   What sysdiagnose collects:
           o   A spindump of the system
           o   Several seconds of fs_usage ouput
           o   Several seconds of top output
           o   Data about kernel zones
           o   Status of loaded kernel extensions
           o   Resident memory usage of user processes
           o   Recent system logs
           o   A System Profiler report
           o   Recent crash reports
           o   Disk usage information
           o   I/O Kit registry information
           o   Network status
           o   If a specific process is supplied as an argument: list of mal-
               loc-allocated buffers in the process's heap is collected
           o   If a specific process is supplied as an argument: data about
               unreferenced malloc buffers in the process's memory is col-
               lected
           o   If a specific process is supplied as an argument: data about
               the virtual memory regions allocated in the process
